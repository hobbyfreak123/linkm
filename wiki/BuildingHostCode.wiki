#summary Building the LinkM library

= Introduction =

How to build the LinkM library and example code.


= Details =

The build process for all LinkM software except the Processing apps is 
expected to be done entirely from the command-line using standard free
Unix-like tools such as "make" and "gcc".

There is a `build_all_host.sh` script that will build the host-side code
on all OS platforms. 

Host code dependencies:
 * The Java library in "java_host" depends on the C library in "c_host"
 * The C library in "c_host" depends on library in "bootloadHID/commandline"

On Mac OS X you will need the following free tools:
 * XCode - http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html
 * libusb - "sudo port install libusb-legacy libusb"  (port is available from http://macports.org/ )

On Windows you will need the following free tools:
 * MinGW - http://www.mingw.org/
 * MSYS - http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS
 * zip - http://stahlworks.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip
 * Java JDK - http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/widget/jdk6.jsp

On Ubuntu Linux you will need the following free tools:
 * build-essential - 'sudo apt-get install build-essential'
 * libusb - 'sudo apt-get install libusb libusb-dev'
 * Sun JDK - 'sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner" && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk'
